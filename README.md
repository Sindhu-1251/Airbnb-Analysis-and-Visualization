# Airbnb Analysis and Visualization

Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their property with people who are looking for accommodations, typically for short stays. Airbnb offers hosts a relatively easy way to earn income from their property, and guests often find Airbnb rentals cheaper and homier than hotels. Airbnb Inc. operates a platform that allows users to list, discover, and book unique accommodations worldwide. The company's mobile application enables hosts to list properties for short-term lease and allows guests to rent or lease accommodations ranging from vacation rentals and apartments to homestays, castles, treehouses, and hotel rooms. Airbnb has a global presence in countries such as China, India, Japan, Australia, Canada, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden, the UK, and others. The company is headquartered in San Francisco, California, USA.

## Problem Statement

This project aims to analyze Airbnb data, perform data cleaning and preparation, develop interactive geospatial visualizations, and create dynamic plots to gain insights into the following aspects of the Airbnb marketplace:

- Pricing variations
- Availability patterns
- Location-based trends

## Technology Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- Plotly
- Streamlit
- MongoDB

## Workflow

- **Data Collection:**
  Gather data from Airbnb's public API or other available sources. Collect information on listings, hosts, reviews, pricing, and location data.

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
  Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data quality. Convert data types, handle duplicates, and standardize formats.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and patterns in the data. Explore relationships between variables and identify potential insights.

- **Visualization:**
  Create visualizations such as charts, graphs, and maps to represent key metrics and trends effectively. Tools like Plotly will be used for interactive visualizations.

- **Geospatial Analysis:**
  Utilize geospatial analysis techniques to understand the geographical distribution of Airbnb listings. This includes mapping out popular areas, analyzing neighborhood characteristics, and visualizing pricing variations across locations.

- **Dashboard Creation:**
  Create a comprehensive dashboard using tools like Tableau or Power BI to present key insights derived from the analysis in a user-friendly format.
